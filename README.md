# Hi #
You might be wondering where the name '0x3C-0x3E' comes from.
Well that makes two of us.

## Origin of my name ##
Originally i wanted to make a simple user name that kind of lines up with my other user names. Something like ghostd ghost333 or something would have been fitting. But being me, i though of _the_ most
obscure way to name myself. '0x3C' and '0x3E' as some might already have noticed are hexcodes. 

## But what do they stand for? ## 
They are ... the values that you have to set %rax to, to make a syscall in x86_64 linux. Very simple.

## What is this account used for? ##
Not a whole lot, mostly backing up my different projects and being able to share them without setting up my own FTP server
